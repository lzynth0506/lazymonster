# Hey yoww!

This is my unofficial portfolio just for my school purposes anyway shoutout to all PHINMA IT
students outthere this thing can help to understand little bit syntax for this matter.

Anyway these are my two tech-stacks that I used:

- NextJS(React Framework)
- TailwindCSS(The Utility First CSS Framework)

And these are the documentations between them

- <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">NextJS Docs</a>
- <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">TailWind Docs</a>
